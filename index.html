    <h1>🥐Croissant Patisserie</h1>

    <p>
      A <strong>croissant</strong> is a buttery, flaky, crescent-shaped pastry
      that originated in <strong>Austria</strong> but became an iconic part of
      <strong>French cuisine</strong>. Made from a
      <strong>laminated dough</strong>, which involves folding layers of butter
      into dough multiple times, croissants are known for their light, airy
      texture and golden, crisp exterior.
      <br />
      The name "croissant" comes from the French word for "crescent,"
      referencing its traditional shape. While the modern croissant is closely
      associated with French baking, its roots trace back to the Austrian
      <strong>kipferl</strong>, a crescent-shaped bread that dates back to the
      13th century. It was popularized in France in the 19th century,
      particularly after Austrian baker <strong>August Zang</strong> opened a
      Viennese bakery in Paris.
      <br />
      Today, croissants are enjoyed around the world, often served plain or
      filled with ingredients like chocolate (pain au chocolat), almonds, or ham
      and cheese. They are a staple in French breakfasts and beloved for their
      delicate texture and rich, buttery flavor.
